# Activity Log 

Short Log where we can write what tasks we performed, what problems we had and other notes (year 2022)

## 30.09
**Main Goal:** Get familiar with the best practices article & github, Create our own github for collaborative editing, wait for further instructions

## 06.10
**Main Goal:** Create Features with CBFV, ML with Random Forest

**Problems:** The Feature vectors had to be built from a pre-existing feature vector which leads to duplicates, data processing needs to be optimized, the ML model is severely overfitting

**Relevant Links:** 


## 07.10
**Main Goal:** Create Crystallographic Feature Vectors with Dscribe, try out xtal2png and ASPH code

**Problems:** xtal2png documentation is not very clear, importing a large amount of .cif files is very slow and required large code adjustments, 

**Relevant Links:** 
* [Folder with .cif files](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lxcpn8hLhO4prCtl5ST7JCamZ2-vnj8h/view)
* [Dscribe Tutorial](https://singroup.github.io/dscribe/latest/tutorials/basics.html)
* [xtal2png](https://github.com/sparks-baird/xtal2png)
* [Topological Representation Article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-021-00493-w.pdf)
* [Topological Representation Github](https://github.com/PKUsamPHTeam/ASPH-Code)

## 12.10
**Main Goal:** FORGOR

**Problems:**

**Relevant Links:**

## 14.10
**Main Goal:** Try out more featurization methods, Create notebook with basics (Lara)

**Problems:**

**Relevant Links:**

## 19.10
**Main Goal:** Feature Visualization and xtal2png

**Problems:** Ram provided by Colab was not enough to do some of the visualization since the feature vectors were 100'000+ long, switched to seaborn which took some time to figure out

**Relevant Links:**

## 21.10
**Main Goal:** Downloading the .cif files with the API, finally doing ASPH code

**Problems:** ASPH returns error (Aria will try it out), not enough time/capacity to do .cif download
