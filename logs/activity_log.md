Short Log where we can write what tasks we performed, what problems we had and other notes (year 2022)

## 30.09
**Main Goal:** Get familiar with the best practices article & github, Create our own github for collaborative editing, wait for further instructions

## 06.10
**Main Goal:** Create Features with CBFV, ML with Random Forest

**Problems:** The Feature vectors had to be built from a pre-existing feature vector which leads to duplicates, data processing needs to be optimized, the ML model is severely overfitting

## 07.10
**Main Goal:** Create Crystallographic Feature Vectors with Dscribe, try out xtal2png and ASPH code

**Problems:** xtal2png documentation is not very clear, importing a large amount of .cif files is very slow and required large code adjustments,
